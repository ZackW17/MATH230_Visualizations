I am a current sophomore at Bucknell University and majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I have made many visualizations, particularly with my MATH 230 class, and would love to share some of my past projects and experiences with you.

The Visualizations page takes you to some of my past visualizations I have made that I'm particularly fond of. The NFL Draft page takes you to an article I wrote about the intricacies of the NFL Draft and includes graphs and images that I created in order to describe a story.
