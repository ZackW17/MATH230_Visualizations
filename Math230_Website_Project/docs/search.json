Do you ever wonder about how hard it is to draft players in the NFL? Hopefully this article can answer some of those questions.\r\nOne of the main ways to categorize a player by how good of a player they are, are the amount of times they went to a pro bowl. The pro bowl is a conglomeration of the best players in the league for each year. To look at how often a player actually makes the pro bowl, we can take a look at the visualization below with data from 1970 to 2021:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly 8.91% of all players drafted made it to the pro bowl, meaning less than a tenth of the players drafted have had at least one season of great success. Not really that high of a chance for a pick to turn out well.\r\nHowever, the round and pick of the draft matters a lot, as typically the higher you are drafted, the higher the projection is for you to succeed. The graph below shows the proportion of pro bowlers in comparison with when they were picked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the graph, being a higher pick in the draft drastically increases your odds to be a better player. But, if players were perfectly prospected, then the proportion of players in the first couple picks should have almost the full majority of players that went to the pro bowl.\r\nEven if you were the first pick of the draft, the odds that you would go to at least one pro bowl aren’t quite as high as we feel like they should. Take this graph below that shows the first pick in about the last fifty drafts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of these players are considered one of the greatest of all time, or on their way there to success, but a lot fo the players on there have not have crazy success. Personally, as a younger person who have not experienced many of the drafts of these players, I maybe know half of these players by name.\r\nDrafting players isn’t perfect, and being the first pick doesn’t guarantee a player’s greatness.\r\nLooking further at the players picked first in every draft, there are some patterns that emerge when looking at the statistics:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the picks by position, there are some positions that teams clearly value more than others. Quarterbacks are by far and away the most popular position to draft, with over 25, but about 75% have been to at least one pro bowl. Even less have had that much prolonged success and been able to elevate the team.\r\nSimply put, the NFL draft is like a lottery, where the more you lose, the better your odds get. As good as your odds are, having the best draft picks, nothing is ever proven in the NFL, and this can cause some distress in fan bases. One might consider the New England Patriots lucky that they got the best steal of any NFl draft with Tom Brady, and the Raiders are extremely unlucky with players like JaMarcus Russell. In my opinion, I think this idea of a lottery applies so much more heavier today than before.\r\nQB’s are some of the most important and team defining players in the NFL. In today’s times, teams are vicariously looking for their next franchise QB, and it shows with this next graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of QB’s taken in the first round has increased a lot in the past few years, whtehr for better or worse. Teams are going big or going home, much like people buying scratchers or lottery tickets in hope of winning the big jackpot. In the 2024 draft of the NFL, six QB’s were taken in the first round. An insane statistic, and one that shows how the game and draft is evolving.\r\nThe game is evolving, and I can see my own team changing as time goes as well. I am a big fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, one team where I think most people would agree is fairly old fashioned. However, they have changed as well and can be seen with the pie charts of Steelers draft picks from 1970-1999 and the 2000s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPositions like LB and DB have dropped around 4 and 5% over the years, and other positions have been drafted more. I think this graph just tells the story of how even the most classic organizations have been trying to change to try and adapt to how the NFL works.\r\nTeams have advanced groups of people analyzing and prospecting athletes before they go into the draft. But looking at the data, there is no surefire way to predict a player’s success, only marginally improving the odds by ways like pick position. So the next time you watch the draft and remark on how well the organization made their decision, remember the only real way to know if they’re a success is to see them play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This dashboard was created to help intro statistics students learn about confidence levels and intervals. All the data in the dashboard can be manipulated, and many of the graphs created were made using ggplot in posit. The dashboard is very interactive, and shows how confidence levels can be helpful when using two different types of data.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostcard Project\r\n\r\nOne of the first projects I had in MATH 230 was to make a postcard detailing a bunch of different data on a subject of my choice. I chose to study and log my eating habits for a week, and then made a visualization based on the data I collected. I decided to separate the visualization for each day I ate, because I wanted to make it prevalent which meals I was eating, and at which times. I added extra data to the visualzation for more information, like for instance, a house symbol indicates that I ate in my dorm, while a bison head indicted that I ate in the Bucknell cafe, called the Bison. The making of the postcard helped me realize important things about my eating habits as well as getting my first introduction into making well-designed visualizations.\r\nThe first picture shown below is the representation of data, and the second picture is a key of what each symbol means.\r\nFront of Postcard\r\nBack of Postcard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGGplot Extensions\r\nThis next visualization is one myself, Dawson Hastings, and Jean Marie Ngabonziza made using ggplot to demonstrate some one of the ggplot extensions in ggdensity. Here, we used the extension to compare the sepal length and petal lengths for iris’s and how they differ for each species. The data set used was named “iris” and is a built in data set in r. This was another visualization that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultivariable Visualization on Plate Sizes\r\nThis visualization is one that I created using a data set about a certain study, where scientists tested whether plate size affects the amount of food people eat. In this sample visualization, I wanted to make a plot that could explain if meal duration affects the participants grams of food consumed, while also looking at the number of servings. As the independent variable, I used the meal duration, and the dependent variable of grams consumed. I decided to use a scatterplot to represent this data, and filed each point with how many servings each participant had. By looking at the graph, it should help explain whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
